#Because strings are lists, you can do to strings everything that you do to lists. You can iterate through them:
# string = "example"
# for c in string:
# 	print "one letter: " + c
# Will give the result:
# one letter: e
# one letter: x
# one letter: a
# one letter: m
# one letter: p
# one letter: l
# one letter: e
# You can take sublists:
# >>> string = "example"
# >>> s = string[0:5]
# >>> print s
