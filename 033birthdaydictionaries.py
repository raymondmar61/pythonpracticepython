#Practice Python 033 Birthday Dictionaries

#For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name. Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them.

#brief review and new concepts for dictionaries
price_dictionary = {"banana": 1.50, "avocado": 0.99, "heirloom tomato": 0.89, "cherry tomato pack": 3.00}
print(price_dictionary["banana"]) #print 1.50
print(price_dictionary.keys()) #print dict_keys["banana", "avocado", "heirloom tomato", "cherry tomato pack"]
price_dictionary["granny smith apple"] = 0.49
print(price_dictionary) #print {'granny smith apple': 0.49, 'heirloom tomato': 0.89, 'cherry tomato pack': 3.0, 'avocado': 0.99, 'banana': 1.5}
price_dictionary["dog food"] = "only at Petco"
print(price_dictionary["dog food"]) #print only at Petco
price_dictionary["dog food"] = 10.33
print(price_dictionary["dog food"]) #print 10.99
print(price_dictionary.get("lemon", "no food like this")) #print no food like this because there is no lemon in price_dictionary
#if we want to check if a particular key is in our dictonary, it is very easy. Just use the in keyword:
print("lemon" in price_dictionary) #print False
print("banana" in price_dictionary) #print True

a = 1
b = 10
#use the .format() method to cast (i.e. transform) your number into a string when it gets printed.
#the variables a and b get converted into strings automatically and injected into our print statement cleanly. You can do this with floats, lists, dictionaries, or anything else you want to display.
print("my number is {} and his number is {}".format(a, b)) #print my number is 1 and his number is 10
print("\n")
